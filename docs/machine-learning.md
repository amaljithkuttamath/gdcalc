# Machine learning

mcdxkit ships a case-name classifier and a set of advisory review checks, both implemented in the package itself with the standard library. They run offline, need no extra dependencies or downloads, and only advise: they never change inputs, case selections, overrides, worksheets or results.

## Case classifier

GROUP case names drive the default selection: names starting with `STR` are strength cases. Other conventions (`Strength I`, `ULS-1`, `Str1`, `Extreme Event II`, project-specific names) stop at "Case classification unavailable".

`mcdxkit inspect` (`case_suggestions`) and **Suggest cases** in the Inputs step classify each final-summary case as `strength`, `service`, `extreme`, `fatigue` or `other`. The classifier is the built-in `case_names` plug-in (`mcdxkit.review.classify.names`).

- **Stage 1, regex:** `STR`/`SER` prefixes and AASHTO long names (`Strength I`, `Service I`) are classified directly with confidence 1.
- **Stage 2, model:** multinomial naive Bayes over character 2-4 grams and whole words of the normalized name, with Laplace smoothing.
- **Training data:** a seed corpus of AASHTO LRFD limit-state names and common abbreviations, plus the engineer's own history. Every completed conversion's audit records the final-summary case names (`case_names`) and which were selected; selected names are learned as strength and unselected names as not strength, weighted 3× over the seed. History comes from a `HistoryStore` (`mcdxkit.review.history`): the browser reads its output directory, the CLI `inspect --history DIR` and `batch --suggest --history DIR` (read once at batch start; never the batch's own output directory, whose selections are automatic), the SDK any store (for example `MemoryHistory` in tests). The audits are read once, before any plug-in runs. Unreadable, dangling, oversized or malformed audits are skipped and counted: the suggestion `basis` (and `case_suggestions.trained_on`) reports `history_skipped`, so a damaged history is visible rather than silently ignored.
- **Abstention:** a case below 80% posterior probability is reported as `unknown` (suggestion `value: null`) and listed in `unresolved_case_ids`.
- **Explanation:** each case lists its confidence, the stage and the name fragments that most favored the predicted class, in a fixed order (ties broken alphabetically, independent of `PYTHONHASHSEED`).
- **Safety:** only `strength` cases are recommended, and the recommended set is checked with the same `select` rules as a manual selection. A set the template cannot use, for example one containing tension, is returned with `selection_issue` and cannot be applied in the browser. Extreme-event cases are classified but never recommended; include them deliberately when the design requires them.

`mcdxkit batch --suggest` records the same `case_suggestions` block, the review flags and the cases that differ from the selection used in each manifest row and in a `suggested_cases` check-table column, to triage many reports at once; it never applies them and the worksheets are unchanged (see [batch triage](cli.md#triage-case-selection-with---suggest)).

`mcdxkit learn` and the `/api/suggest-cases` endpoint were removed: suggestions are part of every inspection, and **Suggest cases** reads them from `/api/inspect`.

## Review checks

**Advisory only, never applied without your click.** Review checks, case-name suggestions and dominance hints never change inputs, case selection, overrides, worksheets or results. The only way a suggestion changes anything is the explicit **Use cases …** button. Tests check that the `.mcdx`, `.cpd` and `.html` bytes and the audit (apart from `review_checks`) are identical with `checks='default'` and `checks='none'`.

`inspect` (CLI, SDK and browser), `convert` and batch audits return a `review_checks` block (schema `review-checks/1`) from the `mcdxkit.review` package. It replaces the earlier `review_flags` key, which in turn replaced the magnitude-based `anomalies` a planted-error validation found misleading (below). The browser shows flags on the Inputs and Changes steps as "Review: …" items. A flag means "check the GROUP input for this case"; it is never a pass or fail, and no flag is not a verification.

```json
"review_checks": {
  "schema": "review-checks/1", "advisory": true, "load_source": "effects",
  "checks_run": [{"id": "ratio_outlier", "version": "2", "kind": "check", "source": "builtin",
                  "params": {"z_threshold": 5.63, "mad_floor": 0.02, "negligible": 0.01, "min_cases": 3},
                  "status": "ok"}],
  "skipped": [],
  "flags": [{"rule": "service_axial_above_strength", "case": 3, "component": "P",
             "message": "Case 3 SER-IX axial load 304.2 exceeds every STR case (largest 256, case 2). ...",
             "value": 304.23, "compared_to": 256.03, "unit": "kip",
             "evidence": {"service": 304.23, "strength_max": 256.03, "strength_case": 2},
             "actions": ["show_in_report", "mark_reviewed"],
             "impact": {"envelope": true, "selection": true, "magnitude": 0.188, "components": ["P"]}}],
  "annotations": [{"annotator": "dominance", "kind": "dominance", "case": null, "component": null,
                   "data": {"basis": "selected", "note": "Selected cases.", "cases": [2, 4, 5],
                            "dominated": [{"case": 4, "dominated_by": [2]}]}}],
  "suggestions": [{"classifier": "case_names", "case": 3, "kind": "limit_state", "value": "service",

  "errors": []
}
```

- A check that does not apply to a report raises `NotApplicable` and is listed in `skipped` with its reason, for example a report with fewer than three cases or the `reactions` load source; it is not reported as clean.
- `impact` says whether acting on the flag could change the selected envelope or the case selection, with `magnitude` the relative size of that change (0.188 = 18.8%) for sorting. A UI can show prominent cards only for items with impact.
- If a plug-in raises (including `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt` or `GeneratorExit`), exceeds its time budget (5 s per report) or returns the wrong types, `errors` gets `{type: "check_error", id, version, message}`, its `checks_run` status is `error`, and inspection or conversion continues. Advisory code never fails a conversion. Python cannot kill a thread, so a timed-out plug-in is abandoned (daemon thread) and its late results are discarded; it is then disabled for the rest of the process, and later runs record `check_error` with the message `disabled after timeout`.
- `convert(..., review_decisions=[...])` records engineer decisions (`included_case`, `kept_service` or `will_fix_in_group`, with `note` and `decided_at`) under `review_checks.decisions`. A decision whose rule ran successfully must match a flag that rule raised. If the rule did not run successfully in this conversion (it raised, timed out, was skipped or is not enabled), the decision cannot be checked: it is kept with `unverified: true` instead of failing the conversion, and is not counted as reviewed in the worksheet note. Only when at least one decision exists does the worksheet gain a plain-text note on the last generated input page: "Automated input checks: N run, M items raised, reviewed by the engineer" (or "K reviewed by the engineer" when only some flags have a decision) and "Checks review the GROUP summary for consistency. They do not verify the design." It sits outside every math region, so the calculation is unchanged. Batch manifest rows and CLI `convert` output count undecided flags as `open_checks` and plug-in failures as `check_errors`. `open_checks` is `null`, not 0, when no check ran successfully (`--checks none`, or every check failed), so "nothing ran" never reads as "nothing to check".

### Plug-ins

| Id | Kind | Version | Module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `service_axial_above_strength` | check | 2 | `review/checks/consistency.py` |
| `effects_below_top` | check | 1 | `review/checks/consistency.py` |
| `duplicate_case` | check | 1 | `review/checks/consistency.py` |
| `ratio_outlier` | check | 2 | `review/checks/ratios.py` |
| `gross_magnitude` | check | 2 | `review/checks/magnitude.py` |
| `governing` | annotator | 1 | `review/annotate/cases.py` |
| `dominance` | annotator | 2 | `review/annotate/cases.py` |
| `case_names` | classifier | 1 | `review/classify/names.py` |

Built-ins are on by default (`--checks default`). Installed plug-ins are discovered from the `mcdxkit.review` entry-point group and stay off until named: `--checks default,my_check` on the CLI, `MCDXKIT_CHECKS=default,my_check` for the server (resolved once at startup). The entry-point name is the plug-in's id, and only the installed plug-ins a `--checks` value names are imported; `mcdxkit checks list` imports them all to show each id, version, kind, source and whether it is on. A plug-in that fails to import, raises while its metadata is read, declares invalid metadata, reuses an id or whose id differs from its entry-point name is listed as an error, not loaded.

A plug-in imports only `mcdxkit.review.api` (standard library only). There is no base class or Protocol to inherit: any object (or class, instantiated without arguments) that declares `kind` (`check`, `annotator` or `classifier`), `id`, `version`, `title` and `params` (its thresholds, recorded in every audit). A check's `run(view, ctx)` yields `Flag` objects whose `rule` is its id; an annotator yields `Annotation`; a classifier's `suggest(view, ctx)` yields `Suggestion`. The `ReportView` is frozen: cases with the load-source ranges used by the envelope (`minimum`, `maximum`), both numeric tables (`pile_top`, `along_pile`), pile ids and source rows, the selected case ids, the load source and units. `ctx.history` is a read-only `HistoryStore` (`case_examples()` returning `(name, selected)` pairs) or `None`. The registry validates these attributes when it loads the plug-in.

```toml
[project.entry-points."mcdxkit.review"]
pile_count = "my_package.checks:PileCount"
```

Every registered plug-in must pass the shared contract tests in `tests/test_review_plugins.py`: deterministic order and output, no mutation of the view, no file or socket I/O while running, and no flags on the clean fixtures. Each built-in check also has a planted-error fixture it must flag.

### Rules

Each rule is a physical or labelling invariant. The only tolerance is 1% for rounding of GROUP's printed values.

| Rule | Flags | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service_axial_above_strength` | A service case whose maximum axial load exceeds every strength case | Axial load only: service lateral loads legitimately exceed strength (AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-1 uses 1.2 TU in Service I against 0.5 in Strength), and comparing lateral components false-alarmed on 12% of the harder corpus. Skipped when no strength case has compression. Recognizes `STR`/`SER` prefixes and AASHTO names such as `Strength I` and `Service I` (the review's own `LIMIT_STATE` pattern). Default case selection is unchanged and still recognizes only the `STR`/`SER` prefixes. |
| `effects_below_top` | The largest magnitude along the pile is below the pile-top reaction for the same quantity | Effects load source only. Pairs (local column → effects column): `LAT. y` 1 → `SHEAR y-DIR` 4, `LAT. z` 2 → `SHEAR z-DIR` 5, `MOM y` 4 → `MOMENT y-DIR` 3, `MOM z` 5 → `MOMENT z-DIR` 2. Compared by magnitude, so it holds whether the effects table uses the same moment sign as the pile-top table (the `tests/test_pipeline.py` fixtures) or the opposite sign (the validation generator); both are tested. GROUP's own conventions are still to be confirmed on real reports. |
| `duplicate_case` | A case whose numeric tables are identical to an earlier case | Usually a copied case. |

### Statistics

- **`ratio_outlier`:** per case, log10 of the lever arms `|Mz|/|Vy|` and `|My|/|Vz|` at the pile top and, for the effects source, the along-pile/top ratios for Mz, My, Vy and Vz. A consistent model keeps these near-constant across cases, while one wrong cell moves them. Each ratio is scored with the Iglewicz-Hoaglin modified z-score `0.6745 (x - median) / MAD` across the report's cases, and the case's largest |z| is flagged above 5.63. The MAD is floored at 0.02 decades (about 5%); in the study this floor made the threshold portable between corpora (3.8 and 4.6), where a 0.001 floor moved it from 4.4 to 16.9. A ratio is undefined when its denominator is below 1% of the report's median for that quantity. Needs 3 defined values per ratio; with fewer, the score cannot exceed 0.67.
- **`gross_magnitude`:** maximum axial load (`P`) and the pile-top lateral resultant `hypot(|Vy|, |Vz|)` (`V`) more than 0.95 decades (about 9×) from the report's median, worded "possible unit slip". Values below 1% of the median, such as a gravity case's 0.02 kip shear beside 15 kip wind cases, are not compared, so a 1/1000 slip downwards is not detected. Needs at least 3 cases.
- **No kip-ft hint.** The earlier kip-ft/kip-in (12×) hint was dropped on purpose: it was wrong for all 17 of 17 moment-unit slips it flagged, because a cap-moment unit slip changes the axial spread across piles rather than making pile moments 12× larger. The lb/kip hint was right for only 57 of 143, so the wording is now only "possible unit slip".

5.63 is the 97.5th percentile of the per-report maximum ratio score, and 0.95 the 97.5th percentile of the magnitude score, on 300 clean reports of the harder synthetic corpus. The 95th percentile, 4.64, shipped first; 5.63 trades 3 points of recall for half the false alarms (table below). Both should be recalibrated on real clean reports, for example with the study's `check_my_reports.py`.

### Case dominance

The `dominance` annotation lists strength cases that can never govern: another considered case is at least as large in every envelope component (P, Vy, Vz, My, Mz). In the harder corpus 51% of strength cases were dominated (median 6 strength cases per report). The browser greys them in the case list and names them under the governing cases. They stay selected; it is a hint about where to look, not a selection.

`basis` is `selected` when a case selection is in use (inspect with a resolved selection, and every conversion audit). When no selection is resolved, inspect uses `fallback_non_extreme`: all cases except names starting with `ext`, `extreme`, `eq` or `seis`. This fallback applies only to the dominance hint. It is labelled as a fallback in the API, audit and UI, and is never used as, or shown as, a case selection; `select` still fails explicitly with "Case classification unavailable". In the study, this basis overshot the true strength envelope by a median of 0% (90th percentile 71%), against 24% (400%) for all cases.

### Evidence

Planted-error validation on synthetic GROUP-format reports from a simplified pile-group model. "Harmful" means the error changes the default STR envelope by more than 5%; reports mcdxkit already refuses are excluded. Each corpus has 400 clean reports and 150 reports for each of 8 planted errors (factor typo, cap-moment unit slip, lateral force in lb, y/z axis swap, STR labelled SER, dropped load, one-cell ×10 or ÷10 edit, effects copied from another case).

Round 2 used a harder corpus: thermal load with AASHTO factors, 0.9D minimum strength cases, extreme-event cases, random combination subsets, four naming styles, batter piles, soil and stiffness scatter and 4-significant-figure output. Study results (harmful recall at the false-alarm rate on clean reports):

| Detector | Round 1 corpus | Harder corpus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Previous `anomalies` (magnitude MAD, z ≥ 3.5) | 46% at 10.5% | 52% at 22.5% |
| Rules + ratio z | 54% at 5.0% | 55% at 4.8% |
| Rules + ratio z + gross magnitude | 64% at 5.0% | **58% at 3.5%** |
| LOF on 400 past reports (not shipped) | 68% at 7.2% | 51% at 5.8% |

The 58% at 3.5% row used a ratio threshold of 5.63 (2.5% calibration) together with the 0.95 magnitude threshold. Re-running the review checks (with the negligible-value floor) on the same corpora at both ratio thresholds gave:

| Configuration | Round 1 corpus | Harder corpus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ratio threshold 5.63 (**shipped**, `ratio_outlier` version 2) | 61% at 4.8% | 57% at 3.5% |
| Ratio threshold 4.64 (previously shipped, for comparison) | 61% at 4.8% | 60% at 7.0% |

On the harder corpus the 4.64 configuration catches: lateral force in lb 100%, one-cell edit 100%, copied effects 100%, STR labelled SER 63%, dropped load 19%, axis swap 12%, factor typo 10%.

### Limits

- The generators are simplified models, not GROUP. The number that matters next is the false-positive rate on real clean reports.
- A sign flip that keeps each minimum at or below its maximum leaves every magnitude, and so the envelope, unchanged; no check can see it. A flip that inverts the extrema is already refused by the parser.
- Dropped loads, axis swaps and factor typos are input-definition errors that output-only checks mostly cannot recover (no detector at about 6% false alarms got past 31% on any of them). Checking GROUP's input echo against the code's factor table would; that needs a real report to learn the echo format.
- History models (LOF), sibling-case statistics and a numeric case picker were evaluated and are deliberately not built. When case names are opaque, only the engineer can select the cases.
- The statistics compare cases within one report. Reports with fewer than three cases get only the rules.

## Governing cases

`inspect` also returns `governing`, built from the `governing` annotator: for each envelope component, the selected case that produces the peak, the runner-up case and the lead ratio. The browser shows it under each value and notes leads of 1.5× or more. With `--checks none` (or without the `governing` annotator) it is `null`.
