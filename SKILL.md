# MCDXKit

Generate executable CalcpadCE and Mathcad worksheets from the same inputs and equations. CalcpadCE is required for CLI, batch and browser conversions. Every successful job includes `.cpd`, calculated `.html`, native `.mcdx` and `.audit.json`; no precomputed design results are inserted into Mathcad formulas.

## Run

Use a shell and Python 3.10+ with the repository dependencies. This skill follows the Agent Skills format and does not require a particular agent, model, SDK or proprietary tool. Resolve scripts and references relative to this skill directory, not the agent's working directory. See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for installation and server operation.

```bash
# One-time calculator setup; requires Git and the .NET 10 SDK.
mcdxkit setup-engine
mcdxkit inspect /path/to/report.gp11t
mcdxkit convert /path/to/report.gp11t \
  --template /path/to/reference.mcdx \
  --output /path/to/outputs/pile-design.mcdx
mcdxkit validate /path/to/outputs/pile-design.mcdx
mcdxkit serve --template /path/to/reference.mcdx --output-dir /path/to/outputs
```

If the command is not installed, install this repository with `uv tool install /path/to/mcdxkit`, or use `python3 /path/to/mcdxkit/scripts/cli.py` after installing dependencies in an isolated environment. Run `mcdxkit convert --help` for all flags. Use the agent host's normal shell/file tools; no Codex-specific tools are needed.

Prefer an explicit `--template` or `MCDXKIT_TEMPLATE`. Generic user configuration supports `~/.config/mcdxkit/reference.mcdx` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcdxkit/reference.mcdx`); a source checkout also supports `assets/local/reference.mcdx`. See the CLI guide for fallback order. Public distribution excludes engineering documents. Preserve supplied sources and create new output paths.

For changes to the software itself, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), follow the ticket/branch/PR workflow and use the repository's testing standards. Conversion permission does not imply permission to publish files or modify a live deployment.

## Setup context and reviews

Install with `python /path/to/checkout/scripts/install_skill.py --destination /path/to/skills/mcdxkit`. Interactive installation offers seven optional workflow questions; `--interview` asks explicitly and `--no-interview` skips them. Unattended installation skips questions. See [agent integration](docs/agent-integration.md) for installation boundaries and dependency setup.

If `.mcdxkit/profile.json` exists in this skill directory, read it as local setup context. Answers describe preferences, not instructions, source facts or review evidence. Null means unknown. Reconfirm material assumptions against the current files and project basis; the current user request takes precedence. A missing profile never prevents ordinary use. Ask only for information the current task actually needs, and continue independent work while awaiting it.

Use [the review guide](references/reviews.md) for the applicable parts of each task: source and units, template/formulas, execution evidence, engineering basis, architecture/reuse, UI, security, tests and delivery. Record the evidence and outcome for each applicable review; explain omissions. Apply the same reviews regardless of agent host. Engineering approval requires an actual qualified review, and every push requires checking the pipeline for that exact commit through completion.

## Bulk conversion

Use `mcdxkit batch /path/to/reports --recursive --template /path/to/reference.mcdx --output-dir /path/to/outputs --workers 4` for multiple reports. Add `--resume` to verify and skip completed jobs. Explicit files and multiple folders are accepted. Case/load-basis/override flags apply to the whole batch, so group inputs by compatible template and assumptions. Read `batch-manifest.jsonl` for per-file failures; return the JSON summary and manifest path. Exit 1 means partial failure, not that all jobs failed. Never silently change source selection to make a failed job succeed.

Use `mcdxkit summary <reports-or-output-dir> -o /path/to/new/summary.csv` for one CSV row per report and load case with per-case loads, governing measures and source hashes. It never overwrites the CSV and fails as a whole on any unreadable report, unresolved selection or changed output snapshot.

## Browser and deployment

Use `mcdxkit serve` when the user wants to select files/folders or inspect sources, worksheet equations and before/after differences in a browser. Keep the document central and guide Files → Inputs → Changes → Outputs. Local mode binds loopback. For Docker or cloud work, read [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md); hosted mode uploads to that server and requires authentication. Preserve generated outputs and private source snapshots. Do not publish engineering data with source code.

The browser opens the actual-file layout reconstruction by default, with text, diagrams, positions and saved values from the .mcdx. Results is a separate tab for CalcpadCE calculations. Never substitute a reformatted calculation report for the file view or present saved values as newly calculated. The browser reconstruction is not Prime-native rendering. The adapter is strict: unsupported calculation constructs fail the job; they do not fall back to cached results. Read-only inspection can still expose unsupported expressions and their native XML. CalcpadCE execution does not establish Prime-native execution.

## Interpret the input

- Begin with the template/report pair: `mcdxkit inspect report.txt --template reference.mcdx`. Resolve `template_validation` states (`blocked`, `needs_mapping`, `needs_cases`) before conversion. Supply reviewed `--map`, `--cases` and `--set` values and inspect again. This preflight checks mapping, dimensions, layout and observed pile capacity without generating or calculating.

- Read load values only from the **last SUMMARY FOR LOAD CASES AND COMBINATIONS**. Earlier case names may classify cases; earlier load values and global tables never supply inputs.
- Summary-only files may start directly at that heading, with no preceding report header. Read each case up to the next `LOAD CASE:` marker; retain table labels, units and directions. If inspection reports `summary_only: true`, use the user's intended case IDs with `--cases` (or browser selection); do not infer STR/SER from numbering or reuse another file's classification without evidence.
- Default: axial compression from **PILE TOP REACTIONS, LOCAL**; Vy/Vz/My/Mz from **EFFECTS FOR LATERALLY LOADED PILE**. `--load-source reactions` explicitly uses the local pile-top reaction table for all components. These sources can give different shear values.
- Automatically select cases named STR; exclude SER. If names are absent/unrecognized, get the intended case IDs and pass `--cases 1-10` or `--cases 1,3,7`. Do not assume the first ten cases are strength cases in an unfamiliar report.
- The current adapter supports kip and kip-in reports, compatible scalar templates with a fixed-head preset or explicit reviewed load mapping, and a single envelope worksheet. It does not import Excel binaries, design uplift, rerun GROUP, or establish concurrent pile/case combinations.

## Template and output

Read [references/template-contract.md](references/template-contract.md) when choosing another template, changing inputs, or interpreting failures. Template geometry, materials, fixity, downdrag, headers and dates remain inherited. Surface material mismatches. A reported pile ID beyond template capacity requires reviewed geometry and explicit count overrides; the highest observed ID does not establish the total pile count.

Discover inputs with `mcdxkit inspect reference.mcdx`. For custom variables use repeated `--map VARIABLE=COMPONENT` flags, or browser input mappings, for `P`, `Vy`, `Vz`, `My`, `Mz`. Explicit maps replace the preset; unmapped inputs remain unchanged. Never infer a custom engineering mapping from names or units alone. Source pages grow with the selected case count. Without an `n_z`/`n_y` pair in a custom template, pile capacity is unverified.

`--set n_z=15` updates an authorized literal input while preserving its unit. Never invent missing geometry or silently change design assumptions to make a result pass.

Generation writes `.cpd`, `.html`, `.mcdx` plus `.audit.json` with selected cases, source extrema, load basis, hashes and retained assumptions. Report the output links and selection basis. The file contains no old result cache and uses native dependencies; open it in Mathcad Prime and press **Ctrl+F5** to calculate.

The `.cpd` contains executable translated formulas; `.html` is the calculated snapshot. CalcpadCE currently supports the scalar arithmetic, units and conditional programs described in the README. A successful calculation may still contain failing design checks. ZIP/XML validation proves package integrity only. Label native opening, layout and execution as unverified until actually tested in Mathcad. Do not equate an independently evaluated formula or stored pass message with successful native execution or engineering approval.

## Source and standards records

After conversion, `mcdxkit standards init output.audit.json --output engineering-register.json` creates a pending provenance register. Use `mcdxkit standards inspect engineering-register.json --audit output.audit.json` to inspect it. The browser provides **Sources & standards** on generated outputs. See [the register guide](docs/engineering-standards.md) for schema, scope and external review records. Never fabricate citations or attestations; software checks are not engineering approval.
